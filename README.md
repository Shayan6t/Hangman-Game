This is a fully interactive Hangman game developed in C++ using the SFML library, designed to blend classic word-guessing gameplay with a visually engaging 2D interface. The game randomly selects a word from one of three categories — Fruits, Clothes, or Animals — and challenges the player to guess it letter by letter. Incorrect guesses gradually reveal a custom-designed hangman figure, while correct ones uncover the hidden word. The game includes smooth keyboard input handling, a scoring system based on remaining lives, and helpful category hints. All sprites and visual elements were created from scratch, making this project a complete end-to-end learning experience in both programming and simple game art. It serves as a fun and educational introduction to SFML-based 2D game development, real-time input, collision-free UI handling, and game state management.
