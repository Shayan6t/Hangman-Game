This project is a fully interactive Hangman game built using C++ and the SFML library. The game randomly selects a word from one of three categories—Fruits, Clothes, or Animals—and challenges the player to guess it letter by letter. Each incorrect guess draws a part of the hangman, while correct guesses reveal letters in the word. The game features a clean graphical interface with colorful letter feedback, a scoring system based on remaining lives, and category hints to help the player. With smooth rendering, keyboard input handling, and visually appealing design using SFML sprites and fonts, this project demonstrates foundational concepts of 2D game development and serves as a fun educational tool for learning game programming in C++.
